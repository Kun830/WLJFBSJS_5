**Q4**

a) Add the two bytes: 11000001, the inverse code of it is 00111110.

b) Add the two bytes: 01000000, the inverse code of it is 10111111.

c) First = 01010100, Second = 01101101.

**Q5**

No, the receiver cannot be absolutely certain that no bit errors have occurred. This is because of the manner in which the checksum for the packet is calculated. If the corresponding bits (that would be added together) of two 16-bit words in the packet were 0 and 1 then even if these get flipped to 1 and 0 respectively, the sum still remains the same.
