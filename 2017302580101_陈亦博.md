P2

Assuming that the ip address of A is a, the ip address of C is c.

From server to message stream:

To host A: source port:26145, destination port:7532. IP address: a

To host C: left:source port:7532, destination port:80. right: source port:26145, destination port:80. Both of them the destination IP address is c.

P4

(aï¼‰ The sum of 01011100 and 01100101 is 11000001, and the complement is 00111110

(b) The sum of 11011010 and 01100101 is 100111111, the length of the result is longer than eight, so the first bit needs add to the last: 01000000, so the complement would be 10111111

(c) For example, both bytes' third bits flipped, so the two bytes turn into 01111100 and 01000101, the answer would not change: 00111110.
