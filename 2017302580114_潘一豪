P2

Assuming that the ip address of A is a, the ip address of C is c.

From server to message stream:

To host A: source port:26145, destination port:7532. IP address: a

To host C: left:source port:7532, destination port:80. right: source port:26145, destination port:80. Both of them the destination IP address is c.

01010011+01100110=10111001
10111001+01110100=1 00101101
00101101+1=00101110   
Complement code:11010001

The advantages of using complement codes:
1.Independent of whether the system is large end or small end.
2.Simple and fast to calaulate the checksum.
The receiver checks the error by adding three bytes to the check sum. If any bit is 0, it indicates an error
1-bit error will definitely lead to different results, however, 2-bit error may not be detected.
