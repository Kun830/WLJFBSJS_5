## P11
This protocol will not work properly.  
1. If action: sndpk = make_pkt(ACK,0,checksum) is removed
   * After sender send a packet, it's waiting in the state 'wait for ACK1'  
   * The receiver get a corrupt packet, then it stay in the current state 'wait for 1 from below'  
   * Enter the dead condition, sender is waiting for ACK1, while receiver is waiting for packet1  
2. If action: sndpk = make_pkt(ACK,1,checksum) is removed  
   * After sender send a packet, it's waiting in the state 'wait for ACK0'  
   * The receiver get a corrupt packet, then it stay in the current state 'wait for 0 from below'  
   * Enter the dead condition, sender is waiting for ACK0, while receiver is waiting for packet0  
In rdt2.2, there is no NCK. ACK uses number to tell the sender whether the packet is intact.  
Once the receiver doesn't send ACK when receiving a corrupted packet, sender will never go on.  
## P15
U = n(L/R) / (RTT + L/R)  
According to the question, L = 1500 bytes  
R = 1 Gbps, L/R = 1500*8/10^9 = 0.012 ms  
RTT = 30 ms  
We must ensure U > 90%  
So n > 0.9/ (0.012/30.012) = 2250.9  
The window size n should at least be 2251.
