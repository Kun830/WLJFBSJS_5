### P4

#### question a

01011100 + 01100101 = 11000001

And the 1s complement of 11000001 is 00111110.

#### question b

11011010 + 01100101

= 100111111

= 00111111 + 00000001

= 01000000

And the 1s complement of 01000000 is 10111111.

#### question c

first byte: 01011101

second byte: 01100100

01011101 + 01100100 

= 11000001 

And it does not change.

### P7

The purpose of the sequence number is that the sender can use sequence numbers to tell the receiver if it has received duplicate packets. But for the ACK packet, if the received data packet contains a sequence number corresponding to the state of the receiver, it will transition to other states, otherwise it will wait. So there is no need to mark the ACK packet.
