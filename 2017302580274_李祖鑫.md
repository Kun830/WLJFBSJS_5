first we add the first two bytes

01010011
01100110
---------
10111001

then the third one

10111001
01110100
---------
00101101

then we take the reverse by bit for 11010010,and we have the checksum 11110010

the reciever add up four 8-bit numbers, and see if all of the bit are 1

The reason for 1s complement for their checksums is that doing so will allow us makes endian independent calculation, that whatever big endian and little endian can calculate the checksums without calling convert function.

1-bit error will always modify the last outcoming, so 1-bit error is impossible to go undetected. While 2-bit error is possible, if 1 goes to 0 meanwhile 0 goes 1 in checksum, then it is possible to get an 0 bit impact on total outcome.


## P5

No. Suppose two bits goes error, then there is possible to have the matched checksum.

Window-based congestion-control has pipling for the package, which may causing congestion when too many paralleled package sent, and this could not be control by doubling of the timeout interval mechanism.
