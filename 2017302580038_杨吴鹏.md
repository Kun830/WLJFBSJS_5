### P5.  
> No, the receiver cannot be absolutely certain that no bit errors have occurred. This is because of the manner in which the checksum for the packet is calculated. If the corresponding bits (that would be added together) of two 16-bit words in the packet were 0 and 1 then even if these get flipped to 1 and 0 respectively, the sum still remains the same. Hence, the 1s complement the receiver calculates will also be the same. This means the checksum will verify even if there was transmission error.
