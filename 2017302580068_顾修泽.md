#### P3
01010011+01100110=10111001<br>
10111001+01110100=1 00101101<br>
00101101+1=00101110   <br>
Complement code:11010001<br>
The advantages of using complement codes:<br>
1.Independent of whether the system is large end or small end.<br>
2.Simple and fast to calaulate the checksum.<br>
The receiver checks the error by adding three bytes to the check sum. If any bit is 0, it indicates an error<br>
1-bit error will definitely lead to different results, however, 2-bit error may not be detected.
#### P7
There is no sequence number for the ACK group because neither the receiver nor the sender needs it.
