### Task 1. UDP checksum

The source code: 

```python
numlist=[0x6660,0x5555,0x8f0c]

def UDPcheckSum(numlist):
    sum=0
    for num in range(0, len(numlist)):
        print('{:016b}'.format(num))
        sum+=numlist[num]
        sum = (sum >> 16) + (sum & 0xffff)
    udp_check=0xffff-sum&0xffff
    print("UDP Checksum: "+'{:016b}'.format(udp_check))
    sum+=udp_check
    sum = (sum >> 16) + (sum & 0xffff)
    print("UDP Checkresult: "+'{:016b}'.format(sum))
    return sum==0xffff

if UDPcheckSum(numlist):
    print("Succeed!")
else:
    print("Fail!")
```

The test result:

### Task 2. Problems in the third chapter

> #### Problem 3
>
> UDP and TCP use 1s complement for their checksums. Suppose you have the folklowing three 8-bit bytes: 01010011, 01100110, 01110100. What is the 1s complement of the sum of these 8-bit bytes? Show all work. Why is it that UDP takes the 1s complement of the sum; that is, why not just use the sum? With the 1s complement scheme, how does the receiver detect errors? Is it possible that a 1-bit error will go undtected? How about a 2-bit error?
>
> ***Answer:*** The sum of these three 8-bit bytes is 00101110, so the 1s complement of the sum is 11010001.
>
> UDP takes the 1s complement of the sum because while checking the error, the sum of the origin three 8-bit bytes and the 1s complement is always 11111111. Once there is a 0, the receiver knows there's an error. Thus it's easier to check the error. What's more, the 1s complement is eadian independent which means it's convenient for transmission.
>
> All the one-bit errors can be detected, but the two-bit errors may not be detected. For example, if the highest bitl of the first byte is converted to 0, while the lowest bit of the second byte is converted to 1 at the same time, the sum can't be affected an thus the error can't be detected. 

> #### Problem 4
>
> a. Suppose you have the following 2 bytes: 01011100 and 01100101. What is the 1s complement of the sum of these 2 bytes? 
>
> ***Answer:*** The sum of these 2 bytes is 11000001, so the 1s complement of the sum is 00111110.
>
> b. Suppose you have the following 2 bytes: 11011010 and 01100101. What is the 1s complement of the sum of these 2 bytes?
>
> ***Answer:***The sum of these 2 bytes is 01000000, so the 1s complement of the sum is 10111111.
>
> c. For the bytes in part(a), give an example where one bit is flipped in each of the 2 bytes and yet the 1s complement doesn't change.
>
> ***Answer:*** 01010100 and 01101101.
