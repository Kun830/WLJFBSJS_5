P26
a)	Yes. His first claim is possible, as long as there are enough peers staying in the swarm for
a long enough time. Bob can always receive data through optimistic unchoking by other
peers
b) true. He can run a client on each host, let each client “free-ride,”
and combine the collected chunks from the different hosts into a single file. He can even
write a small scheduling program to make the different hosts ask for different chunks of
the file. This is actually a kind of Sybil attack in P2P networks.


P30
Yes, you can configure many browsers to open multiple simultaneous connections to a
Web site. The advantage is that you will you potentially download the file faster. The
disadvantage is that you may be hogging the bandwidth, thereby significantly slowing
down the downloads of other users who are sharing the same physical links.
