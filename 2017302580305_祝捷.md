**1 UDP checksum**

- I use matplotlib to implement the checksum calculation
- Click [here](https://github.com/JasonZhu-WHU/Network-distributed/blob/master/hw5/checksum.py) to view the code
- I also summarize and post my learning experience on my personal blog  [UDP checksum](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/123287096)

**2 Problems**

**P3**

01010011

01100110

sum of 1 and 2: 10111001

10111001

01110100

sum: 100101101 -> 00101110 -> complement: 00101110

So the Checksum is 11010001

The reason why we don't use the sum is probably related to the difference between little endian and big endian. In little endian, the least significant bit LSB is in the first bit., which is different from big endian. The calculation of checksum is not dependent on these two, which makes it a good way to check error.

1-bit error will definitely be detected.

But 2-bit error may not be detected in the case if they are in two corresponding index like the case of big endian and small endian.



**P4**

a.

01011100

01100101

sum: 11000001

1s component: 00111110

b.

11011010

01100101

sum: 100111111

1s complement: 10111111

c.

when the numbers change to

01011101

01100100

sum: 11000001

1s component: 00111110

As we can see, the 1s complement doesnâ€™t change.
