P2：

From B to C:
Connection on the left: source port number 80, source IP is B IP;Destination port 26145, destination IP is IP of C;
Connection on the right: source port number 80, source IP is B IP;Destination port 7532, destination IP is IP of C;
From B to A:
Source port number 80, source IP is B IP;Destination port 26145, destination IP is IP of A;

反码为 11010001

Why use the inverse:
It is simple, fast and independent of whether the system is big-endian or small-endian.
The receiver checks for errors by adding three bytes to the check sum, and if any of the bits is 0, an error has occurred.
A 1-bit error can definitely be detected.
Two-bit errors may go undetected, such as two bytes of the same bit being 0 and 1. If you swap them, the result will still be correct.
